# ML Exercises

A repository for Machine Learning excercises with PySpark, Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.
I analyze [Census-Income (KDD) Data Set][l1] and [Bank Marketing Data Set][l2] from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [1].

## PySpark Exercise

The goal was to use PySpark to run a binary classification model on [Census-Income (KDD) Data Set][l1].

**Note:** To run PySpark on your machine (and, therefore, to run this code) you have to have [Java SE Development Kit 8][l2] installed.

## Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow Exercise

The goal was to build and compare two binary classification models to analyse [Bank Marketing Data Set][l2].
There were no restrictions for a specific framework, so I chose to use scikit-learn and tensorflow &mdash; my two favorite frameworks.
